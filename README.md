## Bored-Games
Bored-Games is a two-sided marketplace application designed to enable users to buy and sell board games within their local gaming community. The key aim is to create a one-stop place to search for used games, or for those who have old games and want to ensure that they go to people who will value them.

## The "problem" with used games

Hobbyists and collectors of board games face a few problems that this application tries to solve. 

1. As a seller, where should I advertise my game? There is no central place for selling or giving away old games. Each current option has it's pros and cons, but I'll list a few cons:

    * Op-shops expect you to give them the game for free
    * eBay is flooded with games and auctions (buyers can get lost or put off)
    * Amazon is not suited to small sellers or one-offs
    * Gumtree can be exhausting to scroll through and often shows products unrelated to your search.
    * Some game owners give up and resort to throwing old treasured games in the garbage

2. As a buyer, how can I find a game without searching on every site? It can take a long time to hunt down old games online.

3. Excessive prices by people out to make money from desperate gamers. One of the biggest issues - and a key target of this application - is that some people put ridiculously high prices on games and game parts and advertise them. These games are often not rare or even out of print. Bored-Games will aim to work around this problem.
